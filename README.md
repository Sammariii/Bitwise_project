# Bitwise_project
Welcome to our Cryptocurrency Investment Project, a strategic exploration aimed at providing you with a clear, data-driven understanding of the cryptocurrency market. In this Business Intelligence (BI) initiative, we focus on simplifying complex data to empower our client with valuable insights. Our journey begins with gathering data on cryptocurrency prices, moving averages, RSI analyses, and Blockchain Supply Metrics...... We then meticulously prepare and transform this data, ensuring its integrity and clarity. 

The subsequent steps involve comprehensive cleaning, aggregation, and merging to create a robust dataset for enhanced visualization and analysis. As we load this refined data, we pave the way for constructing Fact-Dimension tables, setting the stage for impactful data analysis. 

Our ultimate goal is to guide our client decisions in navigating the cryptocurrency investment landscape, providing actionable intelligence for a more informed and strategic approach.
